This is a  skin for Rainmeter.  The skin, which is a work in progress, connects to the pitchfork 8.0+ website
and extracts the nth most recent albums listed (n will be determined in the future by default or by user selection).
Note, this is hard coded with the html produced by pitchfork.  As a result, the skin could be rendered useless 
should pitchfork change their tagging MO.

Installation:
extract the folder to 
  C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\
  	(or equivalent)
right click on the rainmeter icon in the system tray, select 'refresh all',
  then the skin should be selectable
